# Getting Started with Deno Fresh

Fresh is a modern web framework for Deno that provides fast and dynamic web applications with zero JavaScript shipped to the client by default.

## Prerequisites

- Install [Deno](https://deno.land/#installation) (Ensure you have Deno v1.28 or later)
- Basic understanding of TypeScript and JavaScript

## Creating a Fresh Project

To create a new Fresh project, run the following command:

```sh
 deno run -A -r https://fresh.deno.dev my-app
```

Replace `my-app` with your desired project name.

## Navigating into the Project

```sh
cd my-app
```

## Running the Development Server

Use the following command to start the development server:

```sh
deno task start
```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Project Structure

A typical Fresh project has the following structure:

```
my-app/
│── routes/        # Route handlers
│── islands/       # Interactive components
│── static/        # Static assets
│── deno.json      # Deno configuration file
│── main.ts        # Entry point
```

## Deploying the Application

Fresh applications can be deployed on Deno Deploy with:

```sh
deno deploy
```
